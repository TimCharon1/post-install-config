### ‚öôÔ∏è osTicket Manual Environment Setup (Windows + IIS)

To manually deploy **osTicket** on a Windows system using **IIS**, I performed the following steps:

1. **Installed PHP Manager for IIS**
   From `PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi` to simplify PHP configuration in IIS.

2. **Installed IIS Rewrite Module**
   Using `rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi` to enable clean URL support for osTicket.

3. **Set Up PHP Directory**
   Created `C:\PHP` and extracted `php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip` into it.

4. **Installed Visual C++ Redistributable**
   Ran `VC_redist.x86.exe` to support PHP runtime.

### üõ†Ô∏è Enabling Required PHP Extensions for osTicket

After installing PHP and launching osTicket in the browser, I received a warning indicating that some required PHP extensions were not enabled. To resolve this, I used **PHP Manager for IIS** to activate the necessary extensions:

1. Opened **IIS Manager**, navigated to:
   `Sites ‚Üí Default Web Site ‚Üí osTicket`

2. Double-clicked **PHP Manager** to access PHP configuration tools.

3. Selected **‚ÄúEnable or disable an extension‚Äù** from the available options.

4. Manually enabled the following extensions:

   * `php_imap.dll` ‚Äì Supports email fetching via IMAP.
   * `php_intl.dll` ‚Äì Provides internationalization support.
   * `php_opcache.dll` ‚Äì Improves PHP performance through opcode caching.

5. Refreshed the osTicket site in the browser to confirm that all required extensions were now enabled and the warning message was resolved.

This step was critical to ensuring full feature compatibility with osTicket, particularly email ticketing and localization features.
